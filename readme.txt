3.1 Plugin: A plugin generates a widget in the case of this Monthly Specials plugin which is generally written in PHP language.
Plugins are designed to enhance the functionality that is present within WordPress through the functions it creates for a website.
Plugins are coded in such a way that users can simply upload them under the plugins section of the WP admin panel and not have to
worry about adding difficult code themselves.

3.2 Widget: Widgets are in the front-end that usually appear within the widgets section under the Appearance tab of WordPress.
Widgets are items that are related to the website's content. For example, a social media widget with clickable icons for a tech savvy blog. 
Essentially, widgets present the data coded in the plugin file to the user in a presentable manner. Widgets give users options
for added functionality to customize the plugin without having to use complex code. For example, adding a title to the widget from the
Widgets section under appearance in WP admin panel, which then appears
on the front-end as well. 

3.3 WordPress Dashboard (WP Dashboard) Admin Panel: This is the backend of WordPress (wp-admin) where you can edit your website. 
It is the very first screen that you see when you log into the admin section of the website. An easy way to remember if you 
forget how to get to the site is add (wp-admin) at the end of your site's url, for example, https://phoenix.sheridanc.on.ca/~ccit3424/wp-admin
The WP Dashboard gives an overview of the posts, pages, comments, and other activity of the site. It is where the user 
can edit posts, approve comments and perform other changes to the site without using any coding such as php or css. If you are 
confused on how to go back to the dashboard after clicking on your site, try clicking on the name of your site that contains the circular
dashboard symbol next to it, in the dropdown menu of this will be a clickable link to the dashboard.

3.4 Posts: Posts are the areas in which a user can create/write content for their site's blog. WP gives users the option
to set a publish time and date along with an organizational tool of categories and tags. Pages tend to have "static" topics about
one thing, whereas posts can be about anything. Posts are more social and can include an area for the user to enable comments.
