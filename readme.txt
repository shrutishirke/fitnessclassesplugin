== 2. Definitions of Terms ==

2.1 Plugin:

2.2 Widget: 

2.3 WordPress Dashboard (WP Dashboard) Admin Panel: This is the backend of WordPress (wp-admin) where you can edit your website. 
It is the very first screen that you see when you log into the admin section of the website. An easy way to remember if you 
forget how to get to the site is add (wp-admin) at the end of your site's url, for example, https://phoenix.sheridanc.on.ca/~ccit3424/wp-admin
The WP Dashboard gives an overview of the posts, pages, comments, and other activity of the site. It is where the user 
can edit posts, approve comments and perform other changes to the site without using any coding such as php or css. If you are 
confused on how to go back to the dashboard after clicking on your site, try clicking on the name of your site that contains the circular
dashboard symbol next to it, in the dropdown menu of this will be a clickable link to the dashboard.

2.4 Posts: Posts are the areas in which a user can create/write content for their site's blog. WP gives users the option
to set a publish time and date along with an organizational tool of categories and tags. Pages tend to have "static" topics about
one thing, whereas posts can be about anything. Posts are more social and can include an area for the user to enable comments.

2.5 Shortcode: The shortcode is a group of functions that can be used within the body of pages or posts inside WP.
The purpose of the shortcode is to eliminate the need for users to write complex lines of code. Shortcodes can create
objects such as buttons, embed files and do many other things!
